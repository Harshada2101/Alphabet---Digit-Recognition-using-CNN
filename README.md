# Alphabet-&-Digit-Recognition-using-CNN

This project focuses on building Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models to recognize handwritten alphabets and digits. Two separate datasets are used for this purpose:

Handwritten Alphabets Dataset

Dataset Source: AZ Handwritten Alphabets in CSV Format
Content: The dataset contains 26 folders (A-Z), each containing handwritten images of alphabets. Each image is centred in a box of 20x20 pixels and saved as grayscale images. A script for converting CSV files to real images in .png format is provided.
Handwritten Digits Dataset

Dataset Source: MNIST Digit Recognizer
Content: This dataset consists of handwritten images of digits (0-9). Each image is saved as a grayscale image. Similar to the alphabet dataset, a script for converting CSV files to real images in .png format is provided.
Usage
Accessing Datasets

Click on the respective links provided to access the datasets on Kaggle.
Converting CSV to Images

Both datasets come in CSV format. To work with images, utilize the provided script named "Kernel CSV To Images" to convert CSV files into real images in .png format.
Building CNN Models

Once the datasets are prepared as images, CNN models can be built using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
